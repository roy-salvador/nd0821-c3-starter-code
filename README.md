# Deploying a Machine Learning Model on Heroku with FastAPI
A project requirement for [Udacity Machine Learning DevOps Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-dev-ops-engineer-nanodegree--nd0821). For full details on the implementation of the project, check the instructions [here](starter/README.md).

To train the ML model, execute the following.
```
cd starter/starter
python train_model.py
```
Aside from the trained model, encoder and label binarizer, it will aslo produce [slice_output.txt](starter/starter/slice_output.txt) which contains overall and data slice performance. More details about the model can be found in the [model card](starter/model_card_template.md).

For proof of setting up CI/CD, the screenshots are included [here](starter/screenshots).
